<!--
  HTML was much easier to write this time, but the CSS was very challenging. I need to reinforce and expand my knowledge of CSS properties.
  
  Really not sure that I applied the image on the right side of the page correctly - feels hacky to me. Will attempt this challenge again, put wanted to post my work for now.

  Looks good at 1440px though, and mobile page looks great at 375px. Not sure how I should style in between though, maybe that is part of the challenge?!
